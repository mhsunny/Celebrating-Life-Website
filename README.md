# Celebrating-Life-Website

A joing initiative of The Daily Star and Standard Chartered Bank
--------

Project description:
=====================
“Celebrating Life” is a composite competition, inviting films, photographs and lyrics entries that showcase various aspects of life in Bangladesh. Organized jointly by The Daily Star and Standard Chartered Bank, this initiative is our attempt to provide participants with a massive platform for creative expression.

Since 2008, the contest has grown enormously in terms of number of participants, number of entries and it has grown far more diverse. This year, Celebrating Life will be even bigger, reaching hundreds of thousands of more people, as the organizers have planned grander events throughout the year to showcase previous and this year’s winning entries. In the spirit of patronizing quality of production over the total number, the awards will be no less prestigious or rewarding than previous years – totaling in almost ten lac takas. Over a dozen more will receive ‘Honourable Mention’ awards, along with crests and certificates. Winners will be announced at the Award Giving Gala Ceremony 2016.

Weeklong festivals will be organized in districts of Bangladesh after the awards are handed over in a grand Gala, showcasing the winning entries from the previous years’ and this year’s contests. We will take the spirit of Celebrating Life to remote areas and villages of Bangladesh, and make sure that the whole nation can participate in the celebrations!

The Theme for Celebrating Life 2017 is “Celebrating Diversity in Bangladesh”.
